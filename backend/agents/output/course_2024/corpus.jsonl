Alice chooses her passwords by randomly & uniformly picking a password from the set \nP. Every password in P has an equal chance to be chosen (i.e. 1/N). In this case, by definition, the entropy of Alice’s password is:\n \n (log2 N) bits \n•\nWhat if Alice doesn’t choose the passwords uniformly, for e.g., the probability that she picks a word starting with letter “A” is higher than \nthe probability that she picks a word starting with “z”? In such cases, the entropy is not (log2 N). By the definition of entropy, it is \n \n \nwhere pi is the probability that Alice picks the i-th word in P. (if we put pi = 1/N, then we get log2 N. )\n•\nIt can be shown that, for the entropy to be highest for a set of N items, pi must be 1/N. In other words, uniform choices.\n•\n(omit if this further confuse you) Another way to measure randomness is min-entropy, which is\n \nSuppose with probability 0.5, Alice picks her password as “Alice”, and for probability 0.5, she uniformly chooses from P. That is, each word in P has probability 1/(2N) being chosen, and “Alice” has 0.5. \nNow, the entropy is roughly ( (log N)- 1 ), which is high. However, there is good chance in correctly guessed her password. So, entropy might not be a good measure of password strength. Note that in \nthis case, the min-entropy is low and is 1, correctly reflects the poor choice. (here, the string “Alice” is not in P)\n48\nY\nz9VbrbdSlIMEiuLHMFEU3QtGNK6lgL9AZh0yatqGZEgyQhm6c+OruHGhiFtfwZ1vYzqdhb+EPj4zmcnD+MGVXacb6twsLi0vJKcbW0tr6xuWVv7zSVSCQmDSyYkO0QKcIoJw1NSP\ntWBIUhYy0wuHVpN56IFJRwe/0KCZ+hPqc9ihG2liBvX8MPZVEQUov3PH9DYwDCj0m+kE1w8AuOxUnE5wHN4cyFUP7C+vK3ASEa4xQ0p1XCfWfoqkpiRclLFIkRHqI+6RjkKCLKT7M\n7xvDQOF3YE9I8rmHm/p5IUaTUK", "metadata": {"lang": "en", "category": "Lectures", "source_path": "/Users/rjustyn1/Documents/IABCAMEII2H/test_data/2025_CS2107_Topic_2_v1.pdf", "page": 48, "images": []}}

In a\nCTF, participants solve problems involving security weaknesses to bypass defences to obtain a sensitive\npiece of information called the \"flag\".\nIn this assignment, participants are exposed to some of the common skills required to play in these\ncompetitions. When using the assignment platform, do not change your username.\nCTF Rules and Guidelines\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE BEGINNING\n1. You are required to log in to CTFd (https://cs2107-ctfd-i.comp.nus.edu.sg) to submit flags. If you are\nunable to access the site, use incognito mode. Make sure you are connected to SoC VPN!\nYou will need an SoC Account to connect, you may apply for one here if you don't have one.\nIf you need help setting up the VPN, do refer to the official docs here. The staff at\nhelpdesk@comp.nus.edu.sg or the IT helpdesk in COM1, Level 1, will be able to help with\nyou setting up if needed.\n2. Do not attack any infrastructure not explicitly authorised in this document. This includes brute-\nforcing flag submissions.\n3. Work individually. Discussion of concepts on the forum is allowed but refrain from posting\nsolutions. Any sharing of answers detected will be reported and disciplinary actions will be taken.\n4. Students may be randomly selected to explain how they obtain their flags, or else a zero mark will\nbe given on their unexplainable challenges.\n5. The skills taught in this assignment are not to be used on any system you do not own or have\nexpress permission to test. This is a criminal offence under the Singapore Computer Misuse and\nCybersecurity Act.\n6. Every challenge will contain a flag and will provide the accepted flag format.

For each pair of k1 and k2, we need 2 encryptions and 2 decryption. There\nis a total of 2112 pairs. Using a straightforward method of applying 2 en-\ncryptions and 2 decryptions for each pairs, the overall is 2114 cryptographic\noperations.\nWe can do slightly better than that. One can exhaustively enumerate k1,\nand for each k1, exhaustively search all k2. So, the number of encryptions\nwill be (number of encryptions using k1) + (number of encryptions using\nk2) = 256 + 2112 ≈2112. We need the same number of operations for k3\nand k4.

As usual, we assume Kerckhoffs’s principle (i.e.\na strong adversary knows the algorithm and all other information except\nthe secret key.)\n(Hints: There are two different ways of attack. The first way needs to know the time. The\nsecond way does not need to know the time. For the second way, note that the int type,\ndepending on OS, is either 16 or 32 bits.)\n3. (Wrong implementation leads to leakage of the secret key.) What is the dif-\nferent of using Java.security.SecureRandom or /dev/urandom compare\nto the the random number generator in question 2? Bob again realised his\nmistake. In his most updated version, the seed s is generated using the\n“secure” random number generator. The hash function H is then similarly\napplied on s to get k and v.\nUnfortunately, there is still a vulnerability in Bob’s implementation. Give\na ciphertext-only attack that finds k?\n(Hint: The IV is derived from the key, and the IV is made public.)\n4. (Online vs offline attack)1\nYou are assessing a password login system. The user keys in the userid\nand password into the client device. Next, the server and client carried\nout a password verification protocol. At the end of the protocol, the server\nwill either accept or reject, and the client will know the outcome.\nThe server is able to carry out verification at a very high rate (say, 10,000\nper second), but it mitigates exhaustive search in two ways: (1) Each\nverification process is intentionally delayed by 1 second; (2) Any user\n(identified by userid) can carry out at most one verification at any one\ntime (hence, an attacker cannot login from 2 different ip-address to try", "metadata": {"lang": "en", "category": "Tutorials", "source_path": "/Users/rjustyn1/Documents/IABCAMEII2H/test_data/2025_tutorial4.pdf", "page": 2, "images": []}}

{"id": "Tutorials_2025_tutorial4_p3::chunk0", "text": "(b) The verification protocol is quite complex and can be summarised\nas below: Let’s call the client the prover and the server the verifier.\nIn this question, for simplicity in analysis, we assume that verifier is\nauthentic and do not consider scenario where an attacker pretends\nto be the verifier.\ni. (P →V : u).\nThe prover gets userid u and password p from\nthe (human) user. Next, the prover sends u to the verifier.\nii. (P ←V : c).\nFrom u, verifier lookups the password p from the\npassword file. Verifier derives a 128-bit key from p by\nk = SHA3(p).\nThe verifier randomly generates a 128-bit string r and sends the\nciphertext\nc = ENC(k, r)\nto the prover, where ENC() is some secure encryption scheme, e.g.\nAES in CBC mode2.\niii. (P →V : h).\nThe prover uses p to get k. Next from c, the\nprover can get r. Prover computes\nh = mac(k, r)\nand sends h to the verifier, where mac is some secure mac scheme,\ne.g. HMAC.\niv. (V accept/reject).\nThe verifier, using its own k, r, check that\nthe received h indeed satifies\nh = mac(k, r).\nIf so, accepts that the prover is authentic and declare “accept”;\notherwise, “reject”.\nThe protocol is to be carried out wirelessly.\nSo, in a reasonable\nattack model, we should assume presence of an eavesdropper, i.e.\nthe attacker can get c, u, h.\n• Derive an “offline attack” and discuss whether 10-character p is\nsufficient.\n• Suppose there is an implementation flaw and r is also fixed with\nvalue 0....0.
