With each passing year, not only has the sheer volume of threats increased, but the threat landscape has become more diverse, with attackers working harder to discover new avenues of attack and cover their tracks while doing so. Coin mining attacks explode Cyber criminals who have been firmly focused on ransomware for revenue generation are now starting to explore other opportunities. During the past year, the astronomical rise in crypto currency values inspired many cyber criminals to shift to coin mining as an alternative revenue source. This coin mining gold rush resulted in an 8,500 percent increase in detections of coinminers on endpoint computers in 2017. Malware Increase in new downloader variants Increase in new malware on macs Increase in coinminer detections 92 [%] 80 [%] 8,500 [%] With a low barrier of entry\u2014only requiring a couple lines of code to operate\u2014cyber criminals are using coinminers to steal computer processing power and cloud CPU usage from consumers and enterprises to mine crypto currency. While the immediate impact of coin mining is typically performance related\u2014slowing down devices, overheating batteries, and in some cases, rendering devices unusable\u2014there are broader implications, particularly for organizations. Corporate networks are at risk of shutdown from coinminers aggressively propagated across their environment. There may also be financial implications for organizations who find themselves billed for cloud CPU usage by coinminers. As malicious coin mining evolves, IoT devices will continue to be ripe targets for exploitation. Symantec already found a 600 percent increase in overall IoT attacks in 2017, which means that cyber criminals could exploit the connected nature of these devices to mine en masse. Supply chain attacks 4 4 10 2016 2015 2017 Spike in software supply chain attacks Despite the EternalBlue exploit wreaking havoc in 2017, the reality is that vulnerabilities are becoming increasingly difficult for attackers to identify and exploit. In response to this, Symantec is now seeing an increase in attackers injecting malware implants into the supply chain to infiltrate unsuspecting organizations, with a 200 percent increase in these attacks\u2014one every month of 2017 as compared to four attacks annually in years prior. Hijacking software updates provides attackers with an entry point for compromising well-protected targets, or to target a specific region or sector. The Petya/NotPetya (Ransom.Petya) Ransom.Petya) ) outbreak was the most notable example: After exploiting Ukrainian accounting software as the point of entry, Petya/ NotPetya used a variety of methods, spreading across corporate networks to deploy the attackers\u2019 malicious payload. Executive Summary 15 02 Executive Summary  | Internet Security Threat Report March 2018 Ransomware business experiences market correction When viewed as a business, it\u2019s clear that ransomware profitability in 2016 led to a crowded market, with overpriced ransom demands. In 2017, the ransomware \u2018market\u2019 made a correction with fewer ransomware families and lower ransom demands\u2014signaling that ransomware has become a commodity. Many cyber criminals may have shifted their focus to coin mining as an alternative to cash in while crypto currency values are high. Some online banking threats have also experienced a renaissance as established ransomware groups have attempted to diversify. Last year, the average ransom demand dropped to $522, less than half the average of the year prior. And while the number of ransomware variants increased by 46 percent, indicating the established criminal groups are still quite productive, the number of ransomware families dropped, suggesting they are innovating less and may have shifted their focus to new, higher value targets. Ransomware WannaCry attacks blocked Increase in new ransomware variants 5.4B 46 [%] Drop in zero days can\u2019t halt the rise in targeted attacks Symantec has found that overall targeted attack activity is up by 10 percent in 2017, motivated primarily by intelligence gathering (90 percent). However, a not-so-insignificant 10 per cent of attack groups engage in some form of disruptive activity. The \u2018living off the land\u2019 trend continues with attack groups opting for tried-and-trusted means to infiltrate target organizations. Spearphishing is the number one infection vector, employed by 71 percent of organized groups in 2017. The use of zero days continues to fall out of favor. In fact, only 27 percent of the 140 targeted attack groups that Symantec tracks have been known to use zero-day vulnerabilities at any point in the past. Mobile malware continues to surge Threats in the mobile space continue to grow year-over-year. The number of new mobile malware variants increased by 54 percent in 2017, as compared to 2016. And last year, an average of 24,000 malicious mobile applications were blocked each day. Mobile Increase in mobile malware variants Average number of malicious mobile apps blocked each day mobile apps blocked each day 24K 54 [%] 17K 27K 2016 2017 While threats are on the increase, the problem is exacerbated by the continued use of older operating systems. In particular, on Android\u2122, only 20 percent of devices are running the newest major version and only 2.3 percent are on the latest minor release. Mobile users also face privacy risks from grayware, apps that aren\u2019t completely malicious but can be troublesome. Symantec found that 63 percent of grayware apps leak the device\u2019s phone number. With grayware increasing by 20 percent in 2017, this isn\u2019t a problem that\u2019s going away.

  "16": "2019 16 01 Executive Summary  | Internet Security Threat Report February 2019 Formjacking. Targeted attacks. Living off the land. Coming for your business. Like flies to honey, miscreants swarm to the latest exploits that promise quick bucks with minimal effort. Ransomware and cryptojacking had their day; now it\u2019s formjacking\u2019s turn. In the Symantec Internet Security Threat Report, Volume 24, we share the latest insights into global threat activity, cyber criminal trends, and attacker motivations. The report analyzes data from Symantec\u2019s Global Intelligence Network, the largest civilian threat intelligence network in the world, which records events from 123 million attack sensors worldwide, blocks 142 million threats daily, and monitors threat activities in more than 157 countries. Cyber criminals get rich quick with formjacking Formjacking attacks are simple and lucrative: cyber criminals load malicious code onto retailers\u2019 websites to steal shoppers\u2019 credit card details, with 4,800+ unique websites compromised on average every month. Both well-known (Ticketmaster and British Airways) and small- medium businesses were attacked, conservatively yielding tens of millions of dollars to bad actors last year. All it takes is 10 stolen credit cards per compromised website to result in a yield of up to $2.2M per month, as each card fetches up to $45 in underground selling forums. With more than 380,000 credit cards stolen, the British Airways attack alone may have netted criminals more than $17 million. Down, but not out Ransomware and cryptojacking were go-to moneymakers for cyber criminals. But 2018 brought diminishing returns, resulting in lower activity. For the first time since 2013, ransomware declined, down 20 percent overall, but up 12 percent for enterprises. With a 90 percent plunge in the value of cryptocurrencies, cryptojacking fell 52 percent in 2018. Still, cryptojacking remains popular due to a low barrier of entry and minimal overhead; Symantec blocked four times as many cryptojacking attacks in 2018 compared to the previous year. Targeted attackers have an appetite for destruction Supply chain and Living-off-the-Land (LotL) attacks are now a cyber crime mainstay: supply chain attacks ballooned by 78 percent in 2018. Living-off-the-land techniques allow attackers to hide inside legitimate processes. For example, the use of malicious PowerShell scripts increased by 1,000 percent last year. Symantec blocks 115,000 malicious PowerShell scripts each month, but this number accounts for less than one percent of overall PowerShell usage. A sledgehammer approach toward blocking all PowerShell activity would disrupt business, further illustrating why LotL techniques have become the preferred tactic for many targeted attack groups, allowing them to fly under the radar. Executive Summary TARGETED ATTACKS ATTACKS 02 Executive Summary  | Internet Security Threat Report February 2019 Attackers also increased their use of tried-and-true methods like spear phishing to infiltrate organizations. While intelligence gathering remains their primary motive, some groups also focus on destruction. Nearly one in ten targeted attack groups now use malware to destroy and disrupt business operations, a 25 percent increase from the previous year. One stark example is Shamoon, which notably re-emerged after , which notably re-emerged after , which notably re-emerged after a two-year absence, deploying wiping malware to delete files on computers of targeted organizations in the Middle East. Cloud challenges: If it\u2019s in the cloud, security\u2019s on you A single misconfigured cloud workload or storage instance could cost an organization millions or cause a compliance nightmare. In 2018, more than 70 million records were stolen or leaked from poorly configured S3 buckets. Off-the-shelf tools on the web allow attackers to identify misconfigured cloud resources. Hardware chip vulnerabilities, including Meltdown, Spectre, and Foreshadow allow intruders to access companies\u2019 protected memory spaces on cloud services hosted on the same physical server. Successful exploitation provides access to memory locations that are normally forbidden. This is particularly problematic for cloud services because while cloud instances have their own virtual processors, they share pools of memory\u2014meaning that a successful attack on a single physical system could result in data being leaked from several cloud instances.",

The repository is public, and thus the whole community is aware of the vulnerabilities.  It is a list of entries\u2014each containing an identification number, a description, and at least one public reference.  Recently well-known: Log4j.

A few CVE could belong to a same CWE.) \u2022 Some vulnerabilities are discovered but not yet published.  These are called \u201czero-day\u201d vulnerabilities.    If an attacker deploy attacks on zero-day vulnerabilities, the victims have \u201czero-day\u201d to react. \u2022 Zero-day vulnerabilities are not easy to get. \u201cZerodium, a company that buys and sells zero day research, lists $1.5 million as the top price it will pay for a single submission.
