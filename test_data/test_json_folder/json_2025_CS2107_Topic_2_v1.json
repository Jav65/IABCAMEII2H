  "48": "Remark:  Password Entropy \u2022 We often encounter this term \u201centropy\u201d when quantifying strength of password.   Entropy is a measurement of randomness.   In this class we won\u2019t go into the definition of entropy. We can use the following example to have a sense of its meaning. \u2022 Suppose a set P contains N unique passwords.    Alice chooses her passwords by randomly & uniformly picking a password from the set P. Every password in P has an equal chance to be chosen (i.e. 1/N).  In this case,  by definition, the entropy of Alice\u2019s password is: ( log2  N 2  N N ) bits \u2022 What if Alice doesn\u2019t choose the passwords uniformly, for e.g., the probability that she picks a word starting with letter \u201cA\u201d is higher than the probability that she picks a word starting with \u201cz\u201d?     In such cases, the entropy is not (log2 N).   By the definition of entropy, it is 2 N).   By the definition of entropy, it is N).   By the definition of entropy, it is where p i   is the probability that Alice picks the is the probability that Alice picks the i -th word in P .  (if we put pi = 1/N,  then we get log2 N.  ) (if we put pi = 1/N,  then we get log2 N.  ) i = 1/N,  then we get log2 N.  ) = 1/N,  then we get log2 N.  ) 2 N.  ) N.  ) \u2022 It can be shown that, for the entropy to be highest for a set of N items, p i must be 1/ N .  In other words, uniform choices. \u2022 (omit if this further confuse you) Another way to measure randomness is min-entropy, which is Suppose with probability 0.5, Alice picks her password as \u201cAlice\u201d, and for probability 0.5, she uniformly chooses from P. That is, each word in P has probability  1/(2N)  being chosen, and \u201cAlice\u201d has 0.5. Now, the entropy is roughly  ( (log N)- 1 ), which is high.  However, there is good chance in correctly guessed her password.  So, entropy might not be a good measure of password strength.   Note that  in this case,  the min-entropy is low and is  1, correctly reflects the poor choice.
