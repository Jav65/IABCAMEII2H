Here is a well-known incident. \u2022 Trustwave issued a \u201csubordinate root certificate\u201d (i.e. the receipt can now issue certificate) to an organization for monitoring the network. With this certificate, the organization can \u201cspoof\u201d X.509 certificates and hence is able to act as the man-in-the-middle of any SSL/TLS connection. \u2022 see ComputerWorld, Trustwave admits issuing man-in-the-middle digital certificate; Mozilla debates punishment , Feb 8 2012. see http://www.computerworld.com/article/2501291/internet/trustwave-admits-issuing-man-in-the-middle-digital-certificate--mozilla-debates-punishment.html 40",

  "42": "Social Engineering PKI \u201dcertifies\u201d the association (name, public key).  In the first place, how the verifiers know that the \u201cname\u201d is correct?  Social engineering exploits confusing naming convention, so that the verifiers are tricked into using a wrong name.  E.g, an attacker first rightfully registered for a domain name that resembles a targeted domain name.  Next, used the registered domain to confuse the victim in phishing attack.  A few techniques to confuse the verifier: \u201cDomain typosquatting\u201d, \u201cHomograph attack\u201d, using sub- domain name. These attack are aka Domain spoofing,  URL spoofing, Fake URL, etc. Method 1 (typosquatting ) 1. An attacker registered for a domain name luminus.nus.edv.sg and obtained a valid certificate of the above name.    No one has registered  edv.sg and thus the attacker is about to get it. 2. The attacker employed \u201cphishing attack\u201d,  tricking the victim to click on the above link, which was a spoofed site of luminus.nus.edv.sg 3. The address bar of the victim\u2019s browser correctly displayed https://luminus.nus.edv.sg luminus.nus.edv.sg but the victim didn\u2019t notice that and logged in using the victim\u2019s password. read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack IDN_homograph_attack k Method 2 (sub-domain ) A more commonly deployed method uses sub domain.  E.g. Attacker is the rightful owner of 134566.com.  Attacker creates a sub.domain luminus.nus.edu.sg.134566.com. Since attacker is the owner of 134566.com, it  can get a valid certificate of  luminus.nus.edu.sg.134566.com  or     *.134566.com 42",
