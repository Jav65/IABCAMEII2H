You have intercepted two ciphertexts C 1 , C 2 generated by a stream cipher generated by a stream cipher using the same secret key. The first 4 bits of the ciphertext form the IV. C 1 = 0111 11011011 C 2 = 0111 00101011 You know that the plaintext must be among the following 4 sequences: P 1 = 00000000 , P 2 = 11111111 , P 3 = 00001111 , P 4 = 11000011 What are the possible plaintexts of C 1 and and C 2? ? 2. ( Meet-in-the-middle ) Instead of applying DES three times, Bob wants to apply it four times with 4 different 56-bit keys k 1 , k 2 , k 3 and and k 4. By using . By using meet-in-the-middle attack, what is the of number of cryptographic opera- tions (including encryption and decryption) required for known-plaintext attack? Give your answer in the form of 2 [k] and approximation (within a multiplicative factor of 2) is suffice. (Remark: Lecture note mentioned that there (Remark: Lecture note mentioned that there is a more efficient meet-in-the-middle attack. Here, the simple meet-in-the-middle in the lecture note is suffice). 3. Alice sends instructions to Bob daily using mobile phone in the following way. Each instruction is represented as ASCII string, and follows the format: action : date The date is the 8-byte \u201cdd/mm/yy\u201d format, and actions are \u201c buy \u201d, \u201c sell \u201d, \u201c sell everything \u201d, and \u201c hold a nd s ee \u201d. Example buy:02/01/22 , sell everything:03/01/22 . The message will be using AES under some mode-of-operation. The ci- phertext, which is a binary string, is then converted to a text message using some tools, e.g. uuencode . The text message is then sent to Bob using SMS. The mobile phone, after each re-start, will set the IV to be the string of all zeros, and then increases it by one (i.e. treat it as binary number and increment by 1, similar to the CTR mode) for every new encryption. An attacker is able to sniff the SMS channel between Alice and Bob. Let us consider two settings:",
  "2": "(a) Suppose the mode-of-operation is CBC mode. What information regarding the plaintext can be inferred by the attacker? Note that under CBC mode, message padding is required if the message length is not multiples of 16-byte. In this question, the padding is simply done by appending bytes of zeros at the end of the message string. (b) Suppose the mode-of-operation is CTR mode. What information regarding the plaintext can be inferred by the attacker? 4. ( Padding Oracle ) Consider the padding oracle attack described in the lec- ture note. Suppose the attacker knows that the 16-byte plaintext is the sequence \u27e8b b 1 , b 2 , b 3 , b 4 , b 5 , b 6 , b 7 , b 8 , b 9 , 00 , 00 , FF , 04 , 04 , 04 , 04 \u27e9 , where the numbers are in hexadecimal representation, and the attacker does not know the value of the bi i \u2019s. Describe how the attacker determine the value of b 9. In particular, describe how to decide the value of . In particular, describe how to decide the value of v in the lecture note. 5. The lecture notes assume the attacker knows the number of padding bytes. Now, consider a scenario where this information is unknown. Suppose the attacker has access to the one-block IV and a two-block ciphertext, but does not know how many padding bytes are present. Describe a method the attacker can use to determine the number of padding bytes, using as few oracle queries as possible. 6. ( Padding oracle attack is practical ) Search the CVE database for a known vulnerability that is based on AES-CBC padding oracle attack. (note: there are also padding oracle attack on other encryption scheme). 7. Find out more about these terminologies: end-to-end encryption Does Whatapps provide end-to-end encryption? Wechat?

  "3": "Hands-on Exercise: Using OpenSSL for prim- itive crypto operations Command line of OpenSSL ( https://www.openssl.org/ ) is a useful tool for the assignment. OpenSSL is a full-featured toolkit for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols, and contains a comprehensive cryptography library. The toolkit comes with the openssl command- line binary , which supports a wide range of cryptographic operations. In other words, an user could invoke the openssl command-line tool, and then ask the tool to carry out some cryptographic operations such as encryption. So, ironically, although it is implemented for SSL, we could use it to carry out basic crypto operation even when we are not using SSL. This is kind of \u201cover-killed\u201d but convenient. Installation. MacOS should already have OpenSSL preinstalled. For Linux, follow the installation step below. To install the OpenSSL binary toolkit, install the OpenSSL package using the following command: $ sudo apt-get install openssl sudo apt-get install openssl Refer to the following documentation on installation of OpenSSL on Ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenSSL . Simple task. Once the package is installed, try running the following command to test the installed OpenSSL and check its version: $ openssl version openssl version To list all available OpenSSL sub-commands, run: $ openssl help openssl help Then, run the following openssl command to benchmark the system\u2019s per- formance on all cryptographic algorithms: $ openssl speed openssl speed Based on the output, answer the following question: \u201cWhich one is faster: RSA signing operation or verification operation?\u201d More info. To find out the details of various cryptographic-related OpenSSL operations, read the following \u201cOpenSSL Command-Line HOWTO\u201d: https://www.madboa.com/geek/openssl/ . Refer to the following man- ual page of various openssl\u2019s (sub) commands: https://www.openssl. org/docs/manmaster/man1/ . 3"
