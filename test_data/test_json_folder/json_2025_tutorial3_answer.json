  "1": "C2107 Tutorial 3 (Password, 2FA, a bit of PKC) Chang E.-C., School of Computing, NUS September 16, 2025 1. Number of 5-words combinations approximately: 2 [10] \u00d7 2 [10] \u00d7 2 [10] \u00d7 2 [10] \u00d7 2 [10] = 2 [50] . Entropy is 50. Answer: 5 \u2022 Remarks : There was an inconsistency on how many bits were re- quired to prevent online dictionary attack between RFC4086 and Q1\u2019s recommendation. In the updated version of Tutorial 3 (v1), the recommendation was changed to 49 to be consistent with RFC. 2. Smaller than 0.5 in order to be more accepting than the server room. Recall again that when threshold is 0, the system accepts everyone; and when it is 1, the system accepts no one, i.e. rejects all. 3. (Token) (a) Consider a malicious PC who performs the following. When the user instructs PC to carry out a transaction, say T , the malicious PC submits another transaction T [\u2032] (for e.g., transfer the money to the attacker\u2019s account) to the bank. The malicious PC then asks the user for the OTP, and submits the OTP to complete the transaction. \u2022 In the In the Token setting, the user would not notice that T is being replaced by T [\u2032] . \u2022 In the In the SMS setting, the full detail of the transaction is included in the SMS. Assuming that user\u2019s phone is not compromised, and the user is attentive, the user can detect that the transaction T [\u2032] is different from the original T . The attack scenario is realistic. (1) The PC could be infected by malware; (2) The PC to an attacker, e.g. Internet Cafe or airport computer (3) Phishing attack, where the user is being tricked to visit a fake website. The fake website plays the role of the fake PC. To study this setting, we need to know more about DNS and https, which will be covered later in network security. (b) Note that here, the laptop/PC is not compromised. \u2022 In the SMS setting, an attacker can sniff the SMS (that is the assumption) and see the detail transaction. So, there is a leak of information. \u2022 In the Token setting, no additional channel for the attacker to In the Token setting, no additional channel for the attacker to get the transaction detail.",
  "2": "(c) \u2022 The attack is same as the attack on Token. We first assume that The attack is same as the attack on Token. We first assume that the PC is malicious. Next, carry out the attack as described earlier. This attack works on M1 but not M2. \u2022 Display partial information. Display partial information. For e.g. \u201cYou have requested to transfer $50,000 from account ending with 3-23 to the account $50,000 from account ending with 3-23 to the account 50,000 from account ending with 3-23 to the account ending with 4-A2, enter OTP: 132373\u201d. 4. Let\u2019s us write c = \u27e8v, c v, c 0 \u27e9 where v is the IV. Note that c 0 is a 33-byte is a 33-byte sequence. Mallory generates c \u2032 = \u27e8 v, c 0 \u2295 (0 21 \u2225 d 4 \u2225 0 8 ) \u27e9 where \u2022 021 is a 21-byte sequence and each byte has value 0 (i.e. 021 is a 21-byte sequence and each byte has value 0 (i.e. 21 is a 21-byte sequence and each byte has value 0 (i.e. is a 21-byte sequence and each byte has value 0 (i.e. a null character); \u2022 d 4 is a 4-byte sequence where value of each byte is is a 4-byte sequence where value of each byte is d , and d is deter- mined in the following way. Let A 0 and and A 9 be ASCII representation be ASCII representation of character 0 and 9 respectively. The byte d = A 0 \u2295 A 9, in other , in other words, d is the different between 0 and 9 . Also note that A 0 \u2295 d is A 9. . \u2022 Likewise, 08 is a 8-byte sequence with value 0. Likewise, 08 is a 8-byte sequence with value 0. 8 is a 8-byte sequence with value 0. is a 8-byte sequence with value 0. (Remark: The notation \u2225 refers to string/sequence concatenation.) Note that the IV in c and c [\u2032] are the same. Decryption of c [\u2032] will give the intended \u201c U x gives U y $ 9999 dollars \u201d? Interestingly, Mallory still doesn\u2019t know x and y . So, even if confidentiality is preserved, Mallory can still compromised integrity. 5. Consider a scenario where an attacker has physical access of the phone and able to unlock it. In such scenario, the attacker by viewing the SMS message, would able to know which account this phone is linked to. Next, the attacker reset the password of those accounts. The OTP would to send to the phone. The attacker can now complete the password reset process. Note that here, the phone become the single point of failure! 6. Smaller exponent leads to faster computation of exponentiation. Google website use DSA. 2"
